# Astro + React + Svelte + Vue + Tailwind. 

## Repo Purpose
Creating an App that will host a bunch of feature pages. From a new quiz app for my wife to a few power bi reports, and other stuff
I'll be using a nest.js backend to keep the functionality well scoped in modules.  I'm going to use each popular ui library.  So far, I'm liking svelte.


## Install
